    <p><strong>Note</strong>: This is using Jest. If you want to see how to test React components using <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a>, Chai, Sinon, and Enzyme, see the <a href="https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react-v1/">v1 version</a> of this workshop.</p>
<p>Now that we have something worth testing, let's test it. We're going to be using Facebook's Jest (v19.0.2) to do it since it has some neat features. Go ahead and add the following to your npm scripts: <code>&quot;test&quot;: &quot;jest&quot;</code>. Then go to your JS directory, create a folder called <code>__tests__</code> inside of js, and create a file called Search.spec.jsx. I like to make my tests live right along side the files they test but I'm okay putting them in another directory: up to you. In either case Jest is smart enough to autodiscover them if you make the extension *.spec.jsx (or *.test.jsx if you prefer that. Also .js is fine too, just not with Airbnb.) The <code>__tests__</code> convention is one Facebook uses and works well. Feel free to use your own sensibilities as nothing is really set in stone here.</p>
<p>In Search.spec.js, put:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install -D jest react-test-renderer
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> React <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"react"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> renderer <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"react-test-renderer"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Search <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"../Search"</span>;

test(<span class="hljs-string">"Search renders correctly"</span>, () =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> component = renderer.create(<span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">Search</span> /&gt;</span>);
  let tree = component.toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
</span></code></pre>
<p>Your linter is probably yelling at you by now. Add <code>&quot;jest&quot;: true,</code> to the env config object. This will ESLint to not warn on Jest's top global variables.</p>
<p>This is a snapshot test and it's a super cool new feature of Jest. Jest is going to render out the component you tell it to and dump the state of that to a file. It's basically a free unit test that the computer generates for you. If the markup changes in the future unexpectedly, your unit test will fail and you'll see why it failed.</p>
<p>So then you may ask, &quot;What happens if I update the component on purpose?&quot; Easy! You run the test again with the -u flag and it will write out new snapshots. Awesome! Also note you're supposed to commit snapshots to git.</p>
<p>Okay, so go the CLI and run <code>yarn test</code> You're going to get some error about import being a bad token; this is true since as of Node.js 7, V8 (the JS engine that power Node.js) still doesn't understand ES6 modules, but we still want to use them in dev so we need to do some special Babel transformations just for testing. Go to your .babelrc file and put this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  <span class="hljs-attr">"presets"</span>: [
    <span class="hljs-string">"react"</span>,
    [
      <span class="hljs-string">"env"</span>,
      {
        <span class="hljs-attr">"targets"</span>: {
          <span class="hljs-attr">"browsers"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"last 2 versions"</span>
        },
        <span class="hljs-attr">"loose"</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">"modules"</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
      }
    ]
  ],
  <span class="hljs-attr">"env"</span>: {
    <span class="hljs-attr">"test"</span>: {
      <span class="hljs-attr">"plugins"</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">"transform-es2015-modules-commonjs"</span>]
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This will add the correct Babel transformation when you are the test environment. Now let's make it so the jest command is run in the test environment (since by default it won't). Go back and change your line in your npm scripts to be <code>&quot;test&quot;: &quot;NODE_ENV=test jest&quot;</code>. Now it will apply that extra transformation for you. Now try running npm t again and see what happens. If it still fails on the import token, run <code>yarn test -- --no-cache</code>. The double dash means you want to pass parameters to whatever npm is running, in this case jest, so the command you're actually running is <code>jest --no-cache</code>. That's a useful trick to know. Then Jest likes to cache Babel transformations for ones it's already done so that you don't have to do it every time; this greatly speeds up running tests but it also doesn't check to see if you updated your .babelrc. So here we need to tell it to do so.</p>
<p>So now that you have a passing test, try modifiying Search and running it again. It'll give you a git diff type output and you can see what changed. If it's what you expect, you just re-run the command with -u at the end, <code>yarn test -- -u</code>. Let's actually put that as an npm script so we don't have to remember that. Add <code>&quot;test:update&quot;: &quot;NODE_ENV=test jest -u&quot;</code> to your npm scripts in package.json.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we have a few problems with this test. First, if we modify ShowCard, it's going to fail this test, and I think that's a problem. As much as possible, we want a Search test to only fail if something in Search breaks, and we want ShowCard to fail if ShowCard breaks. Luckily we can do that with a tool called <a href="http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html">Enzyme</a> from Airbnb. I show you both so you can see the easiest, more official way of doing snapshot testing (with react-test-renderer) and perhaps the more common way with Enzyme. Also, react-test-renderer and Enzyme can't be imported into the same file and we need to use Enzyme for other tests later.</p>
<p>So modifiy your test to read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install -D enzyme jest-serializer-enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 enzyme-to-json
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> React <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"react"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { shallow } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"enzyme"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Search <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"../Search"</span>;

test(<span class="hljs-string">"Search renders correctly"</span>, () =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> component = shallow(<span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">Search</span> /&gt;</span>);
  expect(component).toMatchSnapshot();
});
</span></code></pre>
<p>This still won't quite work the way we want: Jest doesn't know how to correctly serialize Enzyme components for snapshots. However the Jest team knew this would happen and gave us the ability to give a custom serializer. Add this as a top level property to your package.json:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">"jest": {
  "snapshotSerializers": ["jest-serializer-enzyme"]
},
"setupFiles": [
  "./src/jestSetup.js"
]
</code></pre>
<p>Make a file called <strong>tests</strong>/jestSetup.js then put in there:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { configure } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"enzyme"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Adapter <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"enzyme-adapter-react-16"</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">jestSetup</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
  configure({ <span class="hljs-attr">adapter</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Adapter() });
}
</code></pre>
<p>Run <code>yarn test</code> and you can see the difference. Instead of rendering out all the individual shows, we're rendering stubs of ShowCard with the props going into each of them. This ends up being preferable since if ShowCard breaks, it won't break <em>this</em> test. Run <code>yarn test:update</code>. You should see it updated your snapshot and now you're good to keep going. Let's test that if we search on the Search component, it displays the correct amount of shows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// add two imports</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> ShowCard <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"../ShowCard"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> preload <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"../../data.json"</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">// add new test at the bottom</span>
test(<span class="hljs-string">"Search should render correct amount of shows"</span>, () =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> component = shallow(<span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">Search</span> /&gt;</span>);
  expect(preload.shows.length).toEqual(component.find(ShowCard).length);
});
</span></code></pre>
<p>Enzyme gives us lots of useful features. In this case, we can use it to do jQuery-like selections from our app. We can actually ask it, &quot;How many times does it use this React component&quot;. Logically, based on how our app works, it should have a ShowCard for each item in the preload data, so that's what we've checked here. Let's take it a step further and see if it searches correctly.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// underneath the last test</span>
test(<span class="hljs-string">"Search should render correct amount of shows based on search"</span>, () =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> searchWord = <span class="hljs-string">"house"</span>;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> component = shallow(<span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">Search</span> /&gt;</span>);
  component.find("input").simulate("change", { target: { value: searchWord } });
  const showCount = preload.shows.filter(show =&gt;
    `${show.title.toUpperCase()} ${show.description.toUpperCase()}`.includes(
      searchWord.toUpperCase()
    )
  ).length;
  expect(showCount).toEqual(component.find(ShowCard).length);
});
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here we're making sure that the UI displays the correct amount of ShowCards for how many shows it should match. If I were to take this a bit further, I would extract that filter function to a module, test that, and then import that same function into the production environment and the test environment. Here we're duplicating logic which isn't the best idea.</p>
<p>We're using Enzyme's simulate function which simulate's an event on the UI. Do note that as of present, this does <em>not</em> simulate event bubbling: you need to trigger the event on the same element that has the listener. We're making sure that if we type into the search that it filters properly. Keep in mind the way it works is if you call <code>.simulate('click', event)</code> it's actually directly calling the <code>onClick</code> handler directly and not going through an event system.</p>
<p>Enzyme has two other &quot;depths&quot; of rendering besides shallow: full DOM rendering and static page rendering. Full DOM uses <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom">jsdom</a> to put the React app into a DOM-like environment if you need to interact with the DOM APIs. Unless you really need this, avoid it. It's <em>much</em> slower than shallow rendering because jsdom takes a long time to bootstrap and run. You can also do static rendering which uses <a href="https://cheerio.js.org/">Cheerio</a> to parse and interact with the resulting to HTML with a jQuery like environment. Again, I'd avoid this as it is much slower but if you need to do static analysis on the HTML, static rendering is the best way.</p>
<p>And now you get to hear my, Brian Holt's, opinion on unit testing in React: I don't much. This is an unpopular opinion so please evaluate your own decision here. Because my markup changes so frequently as I seek to make the best user experience I can, tests are outdated as soon as they're finished. Thus testing markup is counterproductive because they're constantly failing and out-of-date. Rather, what I do is I extract important pieces of generally-useful pieces of logic and unit test the hell out of those. That way as my markup thrashes and changes, I can still re-use battle-tested pieces of logic to power the UI.</p>
<p>That being said, snapshot testing is <em>so</em> easy and <em>so</em> fast to update, it seems to be worth it to me. I see open source projects using it to great effectiveness and it would be something I would integrate now if I was going to start a new project.</p>
<p>Snapshots can be used for more than just React components. I've seen them used for server responses and even <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier/tree/master/tests">Prettier</a> uses them to test output for their tests. Really anything that has deterministic output and can be serialized can be the target of a snapshot test.</p>
<p>At this point you can go create tests for the other components but you've been taught how and you can go do so yourself. We'll move on.</p>
