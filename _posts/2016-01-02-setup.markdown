In order to be able to complete this entire workshop, we need to go ahead and get some tools downloaded.

## Clone the git repo

[Click here][start] to go clone the `start`

## node.js 8+

You _probably_ can complete this with something less than node 6 but I'm using v10.2.0. If you need to use a different version of Node for work, I strongly recommend using [nvm][nvm]. I recommend getting the binary straight off the [Node website][node] and _not_ using homebrew for installation.

## npm global installs

Run the following global npm installs

```bash
npm install --global jest@v23.1.0
npm install --global nodemon
npm install --global webpack@v4.10.2
npm install --global prettier@v1.13.4
npm install --global eslint@v4.19.1
```

I have you install specific versions so that if the libraries change at all this workshop will all still apply. It doesn't really matter version of nodemon you use. You don't necessarily need these exact versions but you may run into issues if you use different major or minor releases as things make break between versions.
